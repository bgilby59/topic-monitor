# Topic Monitor

## Description
A ROS2 package to monitor the message count and message frequency of given topic(s). 

### Input:
1. One of the following:
    - `yaml` file containing a list of topics, and optionally, frequency requirements ([see example yaml file here for format](https://github.com/bgtier4/rosbag-checker/blob/cpp/input_yaml_format.yaml)).
    - single topic name or regular expression to be monitors.

### Output:
The given list of topics with number of messages recorded by the rosbag, and message frequency.
- Green output indicates that messages corresponding to that topic were found and frequency requirements were met.
- Yellow output indicates that messages corresponding to that topic were found but frequency requirements were NOT met.
- Red output indicates that no messages were found corresponding to that topic.

Output is written to the terminal every `update interval` (default = 1000ms)

## Requirements
- ROS2 Humble
- C++
- `yaml-cpp` C++ library
